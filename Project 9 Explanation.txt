Technological Process
How is gold extracted from ore? Let's look into the process stages.
Mined ore undergoes primary processing to get the ore mixture or rougher feed, which is the raw material for flotation (also known as the rougher process). After flotation, the material is sent to two-stage purification.
[See Image 9_1]
Let's break down the process:
1. Flotation
Gold ore mixture is fed into the float banks to obtain rougher Au concentrate and rougher tails (product residues with a low concentration of valuable metals).
The stability of this process is affected by the volatile and non-optimal physicochemical state of the flotation pulp (a mixture of solid particles and liquid).
2. Purification
The rougher concentrate undergoes two stages of purification. After purification, we have the final concentrate and new tails.
Data description
Technological process

    Rougher feed — raw material
    Rougher additions (or reagent additions) — flotation reagents: Xanthate, Sulphate, Depressant
        Xanthate — promoter or flotation activator;
        Sulphate — sodium sulphide for this particular process;
        Depressant — sodium silicate.
    Rougher process — flotation
    Rougher tails — product residues
    Float banks — flotation unit
    Cleaner process — purification
    Rougher Au — rougher gold concentrate
    Final Au — final gold concentrate

Parameters of stages

    air amount — volume of air
    fluid levels
    feed size — feed particle size
    feed rate

Feature naming
Here's how you name the features:
[stage].[parameter_type].[parameter_name]
Example: rougher.input.feed_ag
Possible values for [stage]:

    rougher — flotation
    primary_cleaner — primary purification
    secondary_cleaner — secondary purification
    final — final characteristics

Possible values for [parameter_type]:

    input — raw material parameters
    output — product parameters
    state — parameters characterizing the current state of the stage
    calculation — calculation characteristics

Recovery calculation
You need to simulate the process of recovering gold from gold ore.
Use the following formula to simulate the recovery process:
	Recovery = (C(F-T)/F(C-T)) * 100
where:

    C — share of gold in the concentrate right after flotation (for finding the rougher concentrate recovery)/after purification (for finding the final concentrate recovery)
    F — share of gold in the feed before flotation (for finding the rougher concentrate recovery)/in the concentrate right after flotation (for finding the final concentrate recovery)
    T — share of gold in the rougher tails right after flotation (for finding the rougher concentrate recovery)/after purification (for finding the final concentrate recovery)

To predict the coefficient, you need to find the share of gold in the concentrate and the tails. Note that both final and rougher concentrates matter.
Evaluation metric
To solve the problem, we will need a new metric. It is called sMAPE, symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error.
It is similar to MAE, but is expressed in relative values instead of absolute ones. Why is it symmetrical? It equally takes into account the scale of both the target and the prediction.
Here’s how sMAPE is calculated:
[See Image 9_3]
Denotation:
    y_i: Value of target for the observation with the i index in the sample used to measure quality.

    y^_i: Value of prediction for the observation with the i index, for example, in the test sample.

    N: Number of observations in the sample.

We need to predict two values:

    rougher concentrate recovery rougher.output.recovery
    final concentrate recovery final.output.recovery

The final metric includes the two values:
