# Practicum by Yandex Projects
These are Data Science projects I completed when going through the Data Science training course in Practicum by Yandex.
They involve Data Preprocessing, Analysis and Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Machine Learning for texts, Time Series, Computer Vision, etc.
